## Problem 1

This is a code chunk for importing the data about penguins.

```{r} 
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This dataset includes information about penguins' species, island of origin, gender, bill-length, bill-depth, flipper length, mass and year of birth.

There are a total of **`r nrow(penguins)`** in this collection, with **`r ncol(penguins)`** collected variables.
